(* TODOs:
 * 0. Have a notion of transaction paths ([TrsPath]) that includes a 
 *    "transaction type" of each object (e.g., upward-request, downward-request,
 *    etc.).
 * 1. An [Atomic] step --> exists a corresponding [TrsPath]
 * 2. For each history [hst] between continuous histories [h1] and [h2]:
 *    we need to have a way to check whether [hst] is right- or left-pushable.
 * 3. 1) Theorem (disjointness between [h1] and [h2]):
 *    [h1 -*- h2], where 
 *    [h1 -*- h2 ≜ rqsOf(h1) -*- rqsOf(h2) /\ rssOf(h1) -*- rssOf(h2)].
 *    Note that [-*-] is not commutative.
 *    2) Theorem (disjointness of [hst]): [∀hst. h1 -*- hst \/ hst -*- h2]
 * 4. Theorem: [∀h1 h2. h1 -*- h2 -> MDisjoint h1 h2 -> Commutable h1 h2]
