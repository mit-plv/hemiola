(* Below we describe a semantic interpretation of a system which has a
 * blocking property.
 *
 * There can be some static conditions for a target [System] to be [Blocking], 
 * for instance, each rule handling messages from a specific external channel 
 * has its own flag to block additional messages from the channel when it is
 * currently handling a certain message from that channel.
 *)

(* A message pool [msgs] is [Blocked] if any two messages in [msgs] whose 
 * original requests [tinfo_rqin] are equivalent (â‰¡m), i.e., from the same
 * external channel, have the same [TInfo].
 *
 * Note that [TInfo] contains both static transaction id ([mid_tid] of
 * [tinfo_rqin]) and dynamic transaction id ([tinfo_tid]).
 *)
Definition Blocked (msgs: Messages TMsg) :=
  forall m1 m2 ti1 ti2,

    tmsg_info m1 = Some ti1 ->

    mid_addr (msg_id (tinfo_rqin ti1)) = mid_addr (msg_id (tinfo_rqin ti2)) ->
    ti1 = ti2.

Definition BlockedInv (tst: TState) :=
  Blocked (tst_msgs tst).

(* When two messages in the same channel are handled, [steps_det] ensures that 
 * the two messages have different [tinfo_tid]s. Thus, if a target [System] has 
 * a blocking property, then any reachable states should be [Blocked].
 *)
