(* Below we describe a semantic interpretation of a system which has a
 * blocking property.
 *
 * There can be some static conditions for a target [System] to be [Blocking], 
 * for instance, each rule handling messages from a specific external channel 
 * has its own flag to block additional messages from the channel when it is
 * currently handling a certain message from that channel.
 *)

(* A message pool [msgs] is [Blocked] if any two messages in [msgs] whose 
 * original requests [tinfo_rqin] are equivalent (â‰¡m), i.e., from the same
 * external channel, have the same [TInfo].
 *
 * Note that [TInfo] contains both static transaction id ([mid_tid] of
 * [tinfo_rqin]) and dynamic transaction id ([tinfo_tid]).
