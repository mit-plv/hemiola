(* Below we describe a semantic interpretation of a system which has a
 * blocking property.
 *
 * There can be some static conditions for a target [System] to be [Blocking].
 * For instance, each rule handling messages from a specific external channel 
 * has its own flag to block additional messages from the channel when it is
 * currently handling a certain message from that channel.
 *)

(* A possible semantic interpretation of a blocking system is:
 * A message pool [msgs] is [Blocked] if any two messages in [msgs] whose 
 * original requests [tinfo_rqin] are equivalent (â‰¡m), i.e., from the same
 * external channel, have the same [TInfo].
 *
 * Note that [TInfo] contains both static transaction id ([mid_tid] of
 * [tinfo_rqin]) and dynamic transaction id ([tinfo_tid]).
 *)
Definition Blocked (msgs: MessagePool TMsg) :=
  forall m1 m2 ti1 ti2,
    InMP m1 msgs -> InMP m2 msgs ->
    tmsg_info m1 = Some ti1 ->
    tmsg_info m2 = Some ti2 ->
    map (fun msg => mid_addr (msg_id msg)) (tinfo_rqin ti1) =
    map (fun msg => mid_addr (msg_id msg)) (tinfo_rqin ti2) ->
    ti1 = ti2.

Definition BlockedInv (tst: TState) :=
  Blocked (tst_msgs tst).

(* This statement looks a bit weird at first glance, since the "first-to-first"
 * property is applied for all internal messages for which [FirstMP] holds.
 * However, it's true since [Blocked] guarantees that given a certain channel 
 * only a single set of messages (originated from the channel) are in
 * [MessagePool]. And those messages are the oldest ones for each channel,
 * which are mapped to the "first" message in spec.
